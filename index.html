							<h2>I don't come from the most traditional background<br />
							for a sports journalist.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I'm a chemical engineer and computer scientist by education, but much to the detriment of my future earning potential, I caught the sports bug during my freshman year at Stanford, thanks to... David<a href="images/shawfaces.png"> </a>Shaw, I guess? <br/><br/>
						Since starting my career on the Stanford women's swimming and diving beat for The Stanford Daily, I've had the privilege to cover two Rose Bowls, the USMNT, my hometown Minnesota Twins, and, most recently and most unbelievably, a no-hitter by Sean Manaea of the Oakland Athletics. <br/><br/>
						But that's not to say I've left my quantitative roots behind. In fact, as data analytics and visualizations become more widely accepted and integrated into mainstream sports thinking, my engineering background and reporting experience complement each other to make me perfectly suited to not only understand and process data, but also to best communicate it to fans and readers.</p>

								<p>Traditional football boxscores make it difficult to quickly understand important elements like the pace of a game and the distribution of runs, passes and special teams plays that illustrate the teams' strategies and how they change over the course of a game. This visualization addresses those issues in its depiction of play-by-play data from the 2013 NCAA Division 1 FBS college football season.</p>
